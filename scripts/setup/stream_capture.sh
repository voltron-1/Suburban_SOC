# SOP-001: Stream live traffic from a capture source through the Zeek container.
# Replaces the formerly-separate stream_bat0_data.sh / stream_br_lan_data.sh /
# stream_raw_data.sh (#173) — same behavior per source, parameterized by mode
# instead of duplicated across three near-identical files.
#
# Usage: stream_capture.sh <bat0|br-lan|raw>
#   bat0    SOP-001-A — SSH to the mesh router (ROUTER_IP, default 10.18.81.1),
#           capture the bat0 (B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced mesh) interface.
#   br-lan  SOP-001-B — SSH to the LAN router (ROUTER_IP, default 192.168.1.233),
#           capture the br-lan (standard bridged LAN) interface.
#   raw     SOP-001-C — local host eth0 capture via sudo tcpdump (no SSH).
#           Must be run with sudo.
#
# ROUTER_USER/ROUTER_IP/LOG_DIR are read from the environment (set by
# soc_pipeline.sh); sensible per-mode defaults are used when run standalone.
