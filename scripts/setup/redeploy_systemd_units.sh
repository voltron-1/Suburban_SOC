# redeploy_systemd_units.sh — apply updated configs/systemd/*.service files to
# the live, installed units on the SOC host (audit #167).
#
# Repo template changes to configs/systemd/*.service never affect the actually
# running services until this (or the equivalent manual steps) is run — see
# each unit's own "Install:" header. Requires sudo.
#
# zeek-host-capture.service is a long-running capture process; restarting it
# briefly interrupts live packet capture, so this script asks before doing so.
# slo-metrics.service is Type=oneshot, triggered by slo-metrics.timer — no
# restart needed, it picks up the new unit definition on its next run after
# `daemon-reload`. This script runs it once immediately to verify.
#
# The slo_metrics ES role + user (audit #167) are a separate, already-applied
# change on the live cluster — this script only touches systemd unit files.
#
# Usage:
#   git pull origin main   # make sure configs/systemd/*.service is current
#   bash scripts/setup/redeploy_systemd_units.sh
