# Evidence Directory

> **Important:** DO NOT upload raw evidence files (like raw PCAPs) directly to this repository. Only store hashes and download links here.
>
> Screenshots are stored in two locations:
> - **Repository:** `evidence/screenshots/` (GitHub-hosted, linked below)
> - **Wiki:** [Suburban_SOC Wiki](https://github.com/sterlinggarnett/Suburban_SOC/wiki) (drag-and-drop uploads)
>
> **Re-capture in progress (audit P0-4).** Some screenshots below predate the security audit and may have been generated from **mock data**. They are being re-captured from **real telemetry** and re-verified per [issue #147](https://github.com/sterlinggarnett/Suburban_SOC/issues/147) (evidence checklist + reviewer instructions). Treat any row not yet re-verified as **PENDING**.

| 6 | N/A (diagram) | Architecture Diagram — full pipeline diagram (OpenWrt → Zeek → Logstash → Elasticsearch → Kibana) with runtime environments and port numbers labeled | Diagram | `e2a59fc5c07432719a484aa7773bda166b46b90634925235fac07bce8064b40f` | [Repo](../docs/architecture-diagram.png) · [Wiki](https://github.com/sterlinggarnett/Suburban_SOC/wiki/Architecture) |
| 7 | ✅ **VERIFIED (real telemetry)** | **A.1 Port scan (T1046)** — Kibana Discover showing two `Scan::Port_Scan` (`zeek.notice`) detections, `source.ip 10.18.81.1` → `destination.ip 10.18.81.14`, msg "probed 20+ distinct ports". Source: router-driven bat0 mesh scan (60 distinct ports). UTC window **2026-06-20T22:50–22:54Z** (notices @ 22:51:11Z, 22:52:24Z). Index `.ds-logstash-security-home-smith-*`. | Screenshot | `9b00d74cf66412d498b9c9a64e62eea7436148403929516cb694f228517cbedf` | [Repo](screenshots/a1-portscan-notice-home-smith.png) |
| 8 | ✅ **VERIFIED (real telemetry)** | **A.2 SSH brute force (T1110)** — Kibana Discover showing 5 `zeek.ssh` sessions from one source `10.18.81.190` → `10.18.81.14` (client OpenSSH_9.6p1). Source: `sim_brute_ssh.sh` over bat0 (NAT'd SOC host). UTC window **2026-06-20T22:13:30–22:16:30Z** (sessions @ 22:14:55Z). Index `.ds-logstash-security-home-smith-*`. | Screenshot | `5868e8f585ca3f73ebb77ac9891362fd54f89adf05b56d8d9ef192de57316fa3` | [Repo](screenshots/a2-ssh-bruteforce-home-smith.png) |
| 9 | ✅ **VERIFIED (SOAR draft)** | **A.2 SOAR action** — `soar-actions-home-smith` draft from a signed `/alert` for attacker `10.18.81.190`: `action.type=analyst_review`, `response.automated=false` (human-in-the-loop), `response.latency_seconds=0.097`; paired append-only `soc-audit-home-smith` record (actor `soc-ai-agent`). UTC `2026-06-20T23:07:39Z`. Drives agent→draft→audit; `/approve`→broker DROP intentionally NOT executed (no real isolation). Auto-trigger (detection→`/alert`) is not yet wired — driven manually here. | Screenshot | `983afcb71488b7aeeece0456e43c1216fd275436967136a11a086d622e4b4a6e` | [Repo](screenshots/a2-soar-action-draft-home-smith.png) |

> **Capture method (reproducible):** screenshots #7–#8 were taken headless via `evidence/capture/capture_kibana.mjs` (Playwright) against the live Kibana, with the time-picker pinned to the stated UTC window. Re-hash the PNG to verify: `sha256sum evidence/screenshots/<file>.png`.
>
> **Detection layer only:** these evidence the Zeek detection → Elasticsearch (`home-smith` tenant) link on real bat0 telemetry. The automated SOAR response loop (detection → agent `/alert` → draft → approve → broker DROP → Case → `soc-audit`) was **not** firing at capture time (no `soar-actions-*` generated; trigger not wired) — tracked separately.

## Verification Notes

- **Pipeline tested:** 2026-05-21 (Full End-to-End Security Validation)
- **Data source:** OpenWrt router (`10.18.81.1`) via SSH/tcpdump → Zeek Docker container
- **Log volume:** Real home network traffic captured on `br-lan` and `bat0` interfaces
- **Dashboard:** `configs/server/suburban_soc_dashboards_bundle_final.ndjson` (importable into Kibana)
- **Index pattern:** `logstash-*` (verified in Kibana Discover)

## How to Verify SHA-256 Hashes

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Get-FileHash evidence\screenshots\kibana-geoip-map.png -Algorithm SHA256
```

**Linux/WSL:**
```bash
sha256sum evidence/screenshots/kibana-geoip-map.png
```
