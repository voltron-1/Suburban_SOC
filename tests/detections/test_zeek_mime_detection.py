test_zeek_mime_detection.py — issue #411: a permanent, re-runnable regression
owner for Zeek's own MIME-detection behavior.

#365 (HTTP) and #382 (SMTP) each live-verified Zeek's real content-magic
mime_type output against the pinned zeek/zeek image ONCE, by hand, and baked
the findings into net_zeek_executable_download.yml/
net_zeek_smtp_attachment_executable.yml's mime_type lists and descriptions.
Neither pass left anything that re-derives ground truth from Zeek itself: a
future image bump that silently changes what Zeek types a real payload as
(the exact class of bug #293/test_zeek_image_pin.py's own header describes
happening once already, for a different Zeek-generated string) would pass
every existing test unchanged, because tests/detections/test_sigma_detections.py
and tests/detections/test_live_fire.py both pin RULE CONTENT and FIXTURE DATA,
never Zeek's own live behavior.

This module closes that gap the same way test_live_fire.py (#221/#387) closed
the analogous "does the real backend actually behave the way we assumed" gap
for Elasticsearch: a real client and a real server exchange real payload
bytes over a real loopback TCP connection, tcpdump captures the real wire
traffic, and the pinned zeek/zeek image (same EXPECTED_TAG/EXPECTED_DIGEST as
tests/pipeline/test_zeek_image_pin.py — bump both together) replays it for
real, exactly as production's offline-PCAP path
(scripts/setup/zeek_run_pcap.sh) does. No hand-crafted packet bytes: the OS
TCP/IP stack builds every header, tcpdump captures exactly what really went
on the wire, and Zeek's own file-analysis framework does the typing — the
same three-real-processes-one-capture shape findings/20260817-384-mime-type-
coverage.md used, just with the server+client+capture on the test runner
instead of nested inside one container (avoids depending on whatever tools
happen to ship inside the minimal zeek/zeek image itself).

Two logsource-specific scenarios, matching the two rules' assumptions:
  - HTTP:  a real `http.server` serves a real shell-script payload; a real
    `curl` fetches it. Asserts files.log types it `text/x-shellscript`
    (net_zeek_executable_download.yml's mime_type list depends on this).
  - SMTP:  a real stdlib `smtpd.SMTPServer` accepts a real `smtplib` session
    carrying the same payload as a base64 MIME attachment. Asserts BOTH
    `mime_type: text/x-shellscript` (content-magic is transport-agnostic,
    #382's own finding) AND `source: SMTP` (#382's specific, independently-
    verified claim that Zeek tags every extracted file with the protocol
    that carried it — net_zeek_smtp_attachment_executable.yml's
    selection_transport depends on this exact field/value).

Python-version note: smtpd/asyncore are deprecated and removed in Python
3.12 — fine while pyproject.toml pins requires-python "<3.12", but a future
bump to 3.12+ needs the SMTP scenario rewritten onto aiosmtpd (the module's
own documented replacement) alongside every other 3.12-blocking change that
bump would need repo-wide.

SKIPPED (not failed) — mirroring test_live_fire.py's own convention — if:
  - the `docker` or `tcpdump` binaries aren't on PATH,
  - the Docker daemon isn't reachable,
  - the pinned zeek/zeek image can't be run (not pulled, no network to pull
    it, wrong architecture, etc.)
so `pytest tests/` stays runnable with no Docker daemon and no raw-capture
privileges. Wired into the same non-required CI `live-fire` job as
test_live_fire.py (.github/workflows/detections.yml), NOT the required,
no-path-filter `detections` job's `tests/pipeline -q` glob — a Docker
image-pull or tcpdump-permission flake here must never block an unrelated
PR, the identical reasoning that job split already documents for
Elasticsearch container-pull flakiness.

class _Capture:
    """tcpdump on loopback, scoped to one TCP port — started before the real
    exchange and stopped after it. A short settle sleep on the start side
    lets tcpdump arm before traffic flows; on the stop side stop() polls the
    save file until it has settled (see that method) rather than guessing a
    fixed delay, so neither the classic capture-not-yet-armed race nor the
    ring-not-yet-drained race this pattern is prone to can truncate the pcap.

    Opening a live capture device needs CAP_NET_RAW/CAP_NET_ADMIN (or root)
    that a plain, unprivileged `tcpdump` invocation does not have on a
    default CI runner user — `sudo -n` (non-interactive: fails fast rather
    than hanging on a password prompt if passwordless sudo isn't configured,
    which GitHub-hosted runners' default user has) covers that regardless of
    the exact capability/group setup a given host uses. First caught live:
    an unprivileged tcpdump here silently produced NO pcap file at all (not
    an empty one — Zeek's own replay step failed with 'unable to open ...:
    No such file or directory'), and neither __init__ nor stop() noticed —
    the Popen process had already exited (permission denied) long before
    stop() ever ran, its failure never surfaced. Both ends now check the
    process actually stayed alive/produced real output, so a future
    regression of this exact class fails loudly at the capture step itself
    instead of a confusing downstream Zeek error two steps later."""
