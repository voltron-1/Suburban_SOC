test_live_fire.py — issue #221: fire real compiled Sigma detections against a
real Elasticsearch, end to end.

sigma_eval.py (test_sigma_detections.py) validates rule *logic* with a Python
re-implementation of Sigma matching — fast, but proven this session (#217's
MEDIUM-3/MEDIUM-4 findings) to miss an entire class of bug: a rule whose field
names do not survive the real suburban-soc-ecs.yml pipeline conversion, or do
not exist in real ECS-shaped data, passes sigma_eval.py's fixture tests while
being a complete no-op in production. This module closes that gap by:

  1. Running the REAL `sigma convert` (same command detections.yml already
     runs) to get the actual compiled Lucene query for a rule.
  2. Translating each fixture event from raw Sigma field names into the same
     ECS-shaped document real telemetry has, using the SAME mapping table
     (configs/detections/suburban-soc-ecs.yml) the pipeline itself uses — not
     a second, hand-maintained translation that could drift from it.
  3. Indexing those documents into a throwaway index carrying the REAL
     production index template's mappings (so string-vs-keyword,
     lowercase_normalizer, and ignore_above behave exactly as they do against
     real telemetry — a dynamic-default mapping would silently pass a test
     that fails in production, or vice versa).
  4. Running the compiled query against that index via Elasticsearch itself,
     not a Python re-implementation.

One rule per category named in the issue's acceptance criteria:
  - process_creation: proc_creation_win_powershell_encoded.yml
  - network:          net_zeek_executable_download.yml — chosen over the other
                       two net_zeek_*.yml rules specifically because its
                       logsource (product: zeek, service: files) IS covered
                       by a real pipeline transformation (source -> zeek.source
                       in suburban-soc-ecs.yml) - this is the exact rule #217's
                       MEDIUM-4 finding was about (the rule queried the
                       pre-rename field name and could never fire), so this
                       is a direct regression test for a documented
                       production incident, not a synthetic example.
  - threshold:         every file in rules/elastic/threshold/*.ndjson (#393:
                       generalized from the original single hardcoded file
                       to all of them, via THRESHOLD_TEST_CONFIGS — 8 at the
                       time, #434 added 2 more later)

Two known scope limits, security-auditor/code-reviewer verified (both reviews
run in parallel per this repo's standing rules) but not fully closed here:
  - Query execution uses a bare query_string with no time-range filter and no
    attempt to reproduce every option Kibana's Detection Engine adds when it
    runs a language:lucene rule (e.g. analyze_wildcard) - confirming exact
    parity needs a live capture from a real Kibana rule execution, not
    something inspectable from this repo alone. The threshold tests DO now
    apply each rule's own from/to window (see _metric_value), which is the
    property that actually matters for those rules' documented purpose.
  - load_pipeline_field_mapping() intentionally reimplements a SIMPLIFIED
    subset of pySigma's real field-mapping precedence (OR across conditions
    and last-transformation-wins on overlap, vs pySigma's real AND-by-default
    and first-transformation-wins) - dormant today because every condition in
    suburban-soc-ecs.yml is a single, mutually-exclusive product/category/
    service triple, but guarded below so a future pipeline change that would
    make the simplification wrong fails loudly instead of silently drifting.

Requires a real, reachable Elasticsearch — SKIPPED (not failed) if one is not
configured, so `pytest tests/` stays runnable with no live cluster. CI
provides an ephemeral, unauthenticated single-node ES service container
(.github/workflows/detections.yml) for exactly this purpose; point
LIVE_FIRE_ES_URL at a real dev-stack cluster to run it locally instead
(defaults assume no auth/TLS, matching the CI container — the dev stack
needs LIVE_FIRE_ES_USER/LIVE_FIRE_ES_PASS/LIVE_FIRE_ES_CA set to authenticate).

    deploy_detections.sh's real `sigma convert -p ...` invocation applies to
    the query, applied here to fixture DATA instead so the two never drift
    apart. Mirrors pysigma's own LogsourceCondition equality check for the
    simple product/category/service conditions this repo's pipeline uses.

    Deliberately simplified vs. real pySigma semantics in two ways
    (code-reviewer finding): multiple rule_conditions entries on one
    transformation are OR'd here, not pySigma's real AND-by-default; and if
    two transformations both matched, the LAST one's mapping wins here, not
    pySigma's real first-applied-consumes-the-field precedence. Both are
    currently dormant — every field_name_mapping transformation in the
    pipeline today has exactly one rule_conditions entry, and the 7
    conditions are mutually exclusive product/category/service triples, so
    at most one field_name_mapping transformation can ever match a given
    rule. Asserted below so a future pipeline change that breaks either
    assumption fails this test loudly instead of silently producing a
    translation that has drifted from what `sigma convert` actually does.

    security-auditor follow-up (#291): this invariant covers field_name_
    mapping transformations only, by construction — the `if t.get("type")
    != "field_name_mapping": continue` filter below is what makes that
    true, not an absence of overlapping rule_conditions in the pipeline as
    a whole. suburban-soc-ecs.yml's add-condition-zeek-event-dataset
    transformation (type: add_condition) is scoped to product:zeek alone
    and DOES overlap all 6 zeek/* field_name_mapping conditions — it's
    filtered out here because it's a different transformation type, not
    because pipeline conditions stayed mutually exclusive. If this filter

# is None for plain-count rules; for cardinality rules it's the dotted path
# that must get a DISTINCT value per indexed document to actually cross the
# cardinality threshold (a repeated value would never cross it, the same
# way `min_doc_count` alone can't distinguish 6 events from 6 DISTINCT
# users without this).
# security-auditor finding (#393): source.ip is explicitly mapped `type:
# ip` in the real production template (configs/elasticsearch/logstash-
# security-template.json), and that same template sets `index.mapping.
# ignore_malformed: true` - a non-IP string written into it is silently
# accepted at the API level (indexes fine, survives in _source) but is
# NEVER actually added to the field's doc-values/inverted index, so a
# terms aggregation on it can never find it. A generic "entity.<label>"
# placeholder string, fine for every keyword-mapped entity field in this
# corpus, silently produces zero-bucket false failures for source.ip
# specifically - caught by the very live-fire testing this fix exists to
# add, not assumed to work. Entity-value generation is therefore
# per-config, defaulting to the descriptive string and overridden only
# where the real field type demands a differently-shaped value.

# cadence.ndjson and its -sustained sibling compile to the byte-identical
# query (event.dataset:zeek.ssh AND client:SSH\-*, live-verified by
# ThresholdQueryMatchesCompiledSigmaTests) and aggregate the same
# source.ip field — a single shared "notcrossed" entity value across both
# would let one file's indexed docs get counted in the OTHER file's
# aggregation within the same test run, since _metric_value's query
# filter can't distinguish them by entity alone. Caught live: an
