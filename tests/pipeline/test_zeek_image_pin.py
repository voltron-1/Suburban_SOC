Static check that zeek/zeek is pinned to a specific, digest-verified image
across all 4 real Zeek capture invocations (#293).

THE BUG CLASS: an unpinned `zeek/zeek` (bare, or `:latest`) lets an
upstream image rebuild silently change any Zeek/OpenSSL-generated string
value a Sigma rule's logic depends on, with no corresponding repo change to
review. Already happened once, live, during #228's review:
net_zeek_ssl_self_signed_c2.yml's first draft assumed OpenSSL's older
"self signed certificate" (space) wording; the real image's OpenSSL 3.0.13
emitted "self-signed certificate" (hyphenated) — a silent, value-level no-op
that would have shipped undetected if a human hadn't happened to diff the
exact string by hand.

A tag alone is not enough: a Docker Hub tag is a mutable pointer the
publisher can re-push at any time (the exact "upstream rebuild changed a
generated string" event class above), and a host with Docker socket access
can `docker tag <anything> zeek/zeek:8.1.1` locally regardless of what the
real registry serves (security-auditor review). Pinning tag+digest closes
both: the digest is content-addressed, so neither a registry re-push nor a
local retag can make `docker run` resolve to different bytes without the
line itself changing.

The 4 real capture paths (grep-confirmed, no other executable invocation —
docs/plans mentioning `zeek/zeek` are excluded from this check, tracked
separately since they aren't something a systemd unit or SOP script runs):
  - scripts/setup/host_capture.sh (#320: the always-on production sensor's
    tcpdump|docker pipeline — factored out of
    configs/systemd/zeek-host-capture.service's own ExecStart= line to close
    a CAPTURE_IFACE shell-interpolation gap; that unit now just invokes this
    script with the interface as a positional argument, and no longer
    contains a real zeek/zeek invocation of its own)
  - scripts/setup/stream_capture.sh (SOP-001-A/B/C: mesh/LAN/raw live streaming)
  - scripts/setup/zeek_connect_host.sh (SOP-001-E: interactive host monitor)
  - scripts/setup/zeek_run_pcap.sh (offline PCAP replay)

Pinning only 3 of the 4, pinning them to different values, or pinning to a
value nobody reviewed is just as silent a failure mode as pinning none —
this test enforces that every real capture path is pinned, and that all 4
match the exact tag+digest this repo's rules were verified against
(EXPECTED_TAG/EXPECTED_DIGEST below), not merely "some tag, not latest".
